# My First Sign-Up Form

This project is a non-responsive sign-up form built using HTML and CSS. It is part of my journey in learning web development and applying modern styling techniques. This project helped me understand form structure, layout design, input validation, and media queries.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox
- Split-screen design with images and form side-by-side
- Styled input fields with client-side validation
- Media query support for mobile view
- Custom fonts via Google Fonts
- Clean, modern visual styling
- Accessibility best practices with labels and placeholders

## Design Highlights

- Left Section: Background image with a centered logo and large "ODIN" label, along with a photo credit overlay at the bottom.
- Right Section: The sign-up form with labeled input fields, helpful placeholders, and a bold call to action.
- Form Validation: Uses HTML5 validation patterns and styling for valid/invalid inputs.
- Mobile-Adjust Friendly: Adjusts layout and input widths for smaller screens.
